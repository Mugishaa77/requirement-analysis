## 📘 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to guide the design and development of a software system.

This process ensures that all project participants — from developers and designers to clients and end-users — have a shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should behave.

---

### 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity & Alignment**: Eliminates misunderstandings by capturing clear expectations from stakeholders.
- **Scope Definition**: Sets clear boundaries for what the system will and will not do, preventing scope creep.
- **Foundation for Design**: Guides technical teams in system architecture, interface design, and functionality.
- **Accurate Planning**: Enables more reliable cost, resource, and time estimates.
- **Quality Assurance**: Acts as the benchmark against which the final product is validated and tested.

---

### 🔄 Where it Fits in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis is one of the earliest phases in the SDLC and influences all subsequent phases:
1. **Planning** — Estimations and feasibility assessments rely on clearly defined requirements.
2. **Design** — System architecture and UI/UX flows are built based on documented needs.
3. **Development** — Code is written to implement the agreed-upon functionality.
4. **Testing** — Test cases are designed to match each requirement.
5. **Deployment & Maintenance** — Changes are easier to manage when requirements are traceable.

---

In summary, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between stakeholder vision and technical implementation. When done correctly, it increases the chances of delivering a successful, valuable, and usable software product.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis process is broken down into five essential activities, each playing a critical role in shaping a successful software project:

---

### 1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️
This is the initial phase where raw data is collected from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.

- Conduct interviews with clients, users, and subject-matter experts.
- Distribute surveys and questionnaires to collect broad insights.
- Organize workshops and focus group discussions.
- Observe users in their work environment to understand real workflows.
- Analyze existing systems and documentation for context.

---

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️
In this phase, collected information is further refined, clarified, and explored to define specific needs.

- Facilitate brainstorming sessions to generate ideas.
- Conduct focus groups to dive deep into user expectations.
- Use prototyping to visualize ideas and receive feedback.
- Address conflicting requirements through discussion and negotiation.

---

### 3. Requirement Documentation 📚
All gathered and refined requirements are recorded in structured, formal documents for review and reference.

- Create a **Requirement Specification Document** detailing functional and non-functional requirements.
- Write **User Stories** to represent requirements from an end-user’s perspective.
- Develop **Use Case Diagrams** to visualize user interactions with the system.

---

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊
This stage involves analyzing and organizing requirements to ensure they are feasible, prioritized, and well understood.

- Prioritize requirements based on business value and urgency.
- Perform feasibility studies considering technical and budget constraints.
- Use modeling tools (e.g., Data Flow Diagrams, ER Diagrams) to visualize workflows and system structure.

---

### 5. Requirement Validation ✅
Finally, the documented requirements are verified and validated with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- Review requirements with stakeholders for approval.
- Define **Acceptance Criteria** for each requirement to guide testing.
- Create a **Traceability Matrix** to ensure all requirements are tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

---

Together, these activities create a structured, stakeholder-aligned blueprint that guides the development of a reliable and effective software product.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: **Functional** and **Non-functional**. Both are essential for building a reliable and user-friendly system.

---

### 🔧 Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements define what the system should do — the specific features, behaviors, and functions the software must support.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- **User Registration:** New users should be able to register by providing their name, email, and password.
- **User Authentication:** Users must be able to log in and log out securely using their credentials.
- **Search Properties:** Users can search available properties using filters like location, price range, and availability dates.
- **Property Listings:** Each property must display relevant details such as images, descriptions, availability, and pricing.
- **Booking System:** Users can select dates, make a booking, cancel or modify bookings, and receive booking confirmation.
- **Admin Management:** Admins should be able to add, edit, or remove property listings and manage user accounts.

---

### 🛡️ Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements describe **how** the system performs its tasks rather than what it does. These requirements ensure the system is usable, secure, reliable, and scalable.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- **Performance:** Pages should load in under 2 seconds, even with up to 1,000 concurrent users.
- **Security:** All user data must be encrypted. Implement secure login (e.g., SSL, hashed passwords) and protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Scalability:** The system should scale horizontally to handle increased traffic, such as during holiday seasons.
- **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive, with clear navigation and accessible design.
- **Reliability:** The system should maintain an uptime of 99.9% and have automatic recovery mechanisms in case of failure.
- **Maintainability:** The system architecture should support easy updates and integration of new features.

---

Understanding both types of requirements ensures that the final system is **functionally complete** and **operationally robust**, meeting both user expectations and technical standards.

## 📊 Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how different types of users (called *actors*) interact with the system to accomplish specific tasks (*use cases*). It helps in understanding system functionality from a user's perspective and is essential for identifying the main features required in development.

---

### 🎯 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- **Clarity**: Easily communicates what the system will do.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Helps stakeholders visualize and validate interactions.
- **Requirement Validation**: Identifies core features and ensures all user goals are captured.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly outlines the boundaries of system functionality.
- **Documentation Aid**: Serves as a foundation for writing user stories and acceptance criteria.

---

### 🧍‍♂️ Actors and Use Cases for the Booking Management System

#### Actors:
- **Guest** (Unregistered user)
- **Registered User** (Customer)
- **Admin** (Platform manager)

#### Use Cases:
- View Properties
