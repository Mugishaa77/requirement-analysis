# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis** phase of a software development project, simulating a real-world scenario for a **booking management system**. The goal is to analyze and define system requirements, create structured documentation, and visualize system interactions to lay a strong foundation for successful development.

---

## 📖 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders. This process ensures that the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations.

---

## ✅ Importance of Requirement Analysis
- 🎯 **Clarity & Understanding**: Reduces ambiguity in project goals.
- 🧭 **Scope Definition**: Prevents scope creep.
- 🧱 **Foundation for Design**: Guides the development and architecture.
- 💰 **Cost & Time Estimation**: Enables accurate planning.
- 🛠️ **Quality Assurance**: Ensures stakeholder satisfaction.

---

## 📋 Key Activities

### 1. Requirement Gathering
- Interviews, surveys, workshops, and document analysis to collect stakeholder needs.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation
- Brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping to refine and clarify requirements.

### 3. Requirement Documentation
- Functional and non-functional requirements written using:
  - 📄 Requirement Specification Documents
  - ✍️ User Stories
  - 📊 Use Case Diagrams

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- 🔍 Prioritization
- ✅ Feasibility Analysis
- 📐 Modeling (e.g., DFDs, ERDs)

### 5. Requirement Validation
- 🧾 Reviews and approvals with stakeholders
- 📌 Acceptance Criteria
- 🔗 Requirement Traceability Matrix

---

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

### 🔧 Functional Requirements
Describe **what** the system should do.
Examples:
- Property search
- Booking system
- User authentication

### 🛡️ Non-functional Requirements
Describe **how** the system should perform.
Examples:
- Performance (load < 2s)
- Scalability
- Usability (intuitive UI/UX)
- Reliability (99.9% uptime)

---

## 📊 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams represent interactions between users and the system.

### Example Use Cases:
- Guest → Search Properties
- Registered User → Book Property
- Admin → Manage Listings

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
Defines specific and measurable conditions a feature must meet.

### Example:
For the Booking System:  
*“Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.”*
